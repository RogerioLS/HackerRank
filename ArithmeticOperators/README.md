### Arithmetic Operators

**Task**

The provided code stub reads two integers from *STDIN*, *a* and *b*. Add code to print three lines where:

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

**Example**

```python
a = 3
b = 5
```

Print the following:

```python
8
-2
15
```

**Input Format**

The first line contains the first integer, *a* .
The second line contains the second integer, *b* .

**Constraints**

* $1 \leq a \leq 10^{10}$
* $1 \leq b \leq 10^{10}$

**Output Format**

Print the three lines as explained above.

**Sample Input 0**

```python
3
2
```

**Sample Output 0**

```python
5
1
6
```

**Explanation 0**

* $3 + 2 \Rightarrow 5$
* $3 - 2 \Rightarrow 2$
* $3 * 2 \Rightarrow 6$
